4. As of now the site is very basic but if you were to want to build onto it, you could for example:
       
       Change the js to just run the server rather than be a very basic site and create a full website using HTML, CSS and JS.
       one way of inserting the HTML would be: 
     "   function(req, res)
    {
        res.sendFile('index.html', { root: __dirname }); 
        //this 2nd argument says look into this directory we are already in and find that 1st file path. 
    }
    "
    This will send the html to the server to be displayed by Heroku or whatever hosting service you are currently using.
